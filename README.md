# 2d algorithms showcase

## === Pathfinding algorithms ===
 
    -> AStar pathfinding
    -> Dijkstra pathfinding
    -> Jump Point pathfinding on the map with the cells grid
    
## === 2d shapes algorithms === 

    -> Vectors product & segments intersection
    -> Random 2d line simplification
    -> Jarvis alg for a random points set 
    -> Graham alg for a random points set
    -> Quick Hull alg for a random points set
    -> Shape decimating (simplification) alg
    -> Shape functions: 
        - normailze
        - bypass all points (on the perimetr or inside the shape area)
        - is point inside the shape
